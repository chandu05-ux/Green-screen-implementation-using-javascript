# Green-screen-implementation-using-javascript
steps to follow
I HAVE LEARNT AND USED DUKELEARNTOPROGRAM WEBSITE IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE GREEN SCREEN IMPLEMENTATION USING JAVASCRIPT
USE THE FOLLOWING LINK IN ORDER TO START CODING - https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//course1/example/index.php
1. FIRST TAKE TWO IMAGES BACKGROUND IMAGE - ONE IMAGE CONTAINING GREEN IMAGE AND FOREGROUND IMAGE - ANOTHER NORMAL IMAGE OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE GREEN IMAGE
2. CREATE A THIRD OUTPUT IMAGE WHICH IS AN EMPTY IMAGE BUT HAS HEIGHT AND WIDTH OF THE FOREGROUND IMAGE
3. NOW COMPARE EACH PIXEL OF FOREGROUND IMAGE WITH BACKGROUND IMAGE. IF BACKGROUND PIXEL IS GREEN THEN ADD THE FOREGROUND PIXEL TO THE OUTPUT IMAGE.
4. ELSE ADD THE FOREGROUND IMAGE PIXEL TO THE OUTPUT IMAGE.
5. PRINT THE OUTPUT IMAGE
